# Final Fantasy XIV Housing Cost Estimate
This is NOT a tool to estimate the real world housing cost!
This is a tool to **estimate** how much it will cost to get all the housing items used for a Final Fantasy XIV Housing design made with the Program MakePlace.

It uses the *-list.txt* file to check for vendor prices, if it could be crafted, if it is from the online store, and if it can be bought from the marketboard.
It will also get the current marketboard listings for a the items, giving a estimate on how much it will cost, and from which server. Also it will show how much it would cost, if bought from the user specified server.

this tool is mainly used by myself to help me cut costs on builds.
It is also available on [https://housing.ashyro.io](https://housing.ashyro.io/) if you want to test it out.

# Features
- Drag and Drop or Search through filesystem
- Simple overview of information how to get the item
- Export the result as CSV to use it in Excel or Google Sheet for example

# How to use
Simply drag and drop the MakePlace *-list.txt file on the Dropzone
Select a World / Server
Done, you have now a rough estimate of how much it would cost to buy all the items
You can download the results as a csv if you wish

# Future plans
- ~~I need to implement the marketboard data yet~~
- Add the same functionality for Dyes to see which dyes can be bought from vendor, can be crafted, or bought from marketboard
- ~~Use a cookie to store the selected World / Server, so it doesn't need to be selected everytime~~
- Add Tooltips or a little "How to" on the site
- Make it more pretty but still minimal and clean
- Keep the performance high
